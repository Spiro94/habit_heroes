# Habit Heroes

Habit Heroes is a gamified family habit-tracking app with two modules:

- **Parent Module:** Parents can create and manage daily or weekly tasks for
  their kids, categorized by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening). Each
  task can include a title, description, repetition settings, selected days of
  the week, and a point value. Parents can also create custom rewards that kids
  can redeem with earned points.
- **Kids Module:** Kids have a fun interface where they can view their tasks and
  mark them as completed to earn points. A rewards tab lets them browse
  available rewards and redeem their points for items or privileges.

The app promotes positive habits, responsibility, and family engagement through
playful gamification, built in Flutter for scalability and cross-platform
performance.
